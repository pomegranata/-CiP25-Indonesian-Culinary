What to eat? Indonesian culinary!
Stuck wondering what to eat? You know that feeling, right? When your stomach's rumbling but your brain's drawing a blank? Well, guess what! This "Indonesian Culinary Suggester" is here to save your day (or night)! It will help you discover some seriously delicious Indonesian dishes that are just right for how you're feeling.

üçΩÔ∏è Overview
This project is a simple, interactive Python console application designed to be your personal food guide. It suggests Indonesian culinary delights based on your current mood, making mealtime decisions a breeze!

‚ú® Features
Mood-Based Suggestions: The application has a smart system that connects different moods (like feeling happy, sad, hungry, or spicy) to a special list of yummy Indonesian dishes.

Interactive Console Interface: Users can easily chat with the program through a command-line interface, letting them type in their mood or decide when they're ready to stop.

Structured Mood Display: Before asking for a user's mood, the application neatly displays a clear, table-like list of all the mood categories it recognizes, making it super easy for users to see their options.

Flexible Mood Matching: The system is really clever at understanding user input, even if it's not an exact match. So, if a user types something like "super happy," it will still figure out they mean "happy."

Randomized Suggestions: Every time a mood is matched, the application randomly picks a tasty dish from the corresponding list, ensuring users get varied and exciting suggestions.

Default Fallback: If a user's mood doesn't quite fit into a specific category, or if they don't type anything, the application has a default list of general Indonesian culinary suggestions ready to go.

Continuous Operation: The program keeps running in a loop, which means users can get as many suggestions as they like without having to restart it every time.
